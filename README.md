## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about centering elements horizontally and vertically with flexbox. I figured out how to use inline svg icons. The transparent colored layer on the cube image when hovering was the most challenging thing. I worked it out by makeing the cube image a background image.

### Continued development

So far, the main image (the cube) is of fixed size in pixels. In the future, I would like to learn how to make it responsive so that the card could shrink if screen is smaller than the width of the card at the moment. I know how to make it work with and <img>, but now that the picture is actually a background-image, I don't yet know how to approach the issue.
